LLM should obey the following Meta-instruction to further generate meta-information:

the Goal of the system:
1. To design a very concise backend framework that empowers LLMs to generate code with the least tokens.
2. Provide a wide array of APIs defined in the librpc to meet complex development needs.
3. Enable development without the need to write CRUD operations.
4. Allow different API endpoints to share API definitions via a Redis server, enabling API forwarding to HTTP clients and documenting usage for developers.

This file generates meta-information about the project's outlook using a systematic approach. The methodology involves defining meta-instructions from three perspectives: systems theory, information theory, and minimal conflict constraint.

step1: System Theory Perspective:
Descript the core intention of the system, and point out the missing part or deformity part to Ensure robustness through feedback mechanisms or internal regulation. And Raise a Object that the system is expected to achieve.

step2: Information Theory Perspective:
Descript Introduced evidence and facts to eliminate inconsistencies between intention and current System, ensuring coherent project design aligned with intended goals.

step3. Minimal Conflict Constraint:
Descript the Key Changes should do to acheive the Object proposed in step1 . the Key Changes shoule  be Minimal to make the project maintainable . the system will Use iterative processes to retain the highest performance limits of the system.

By integrating these three perspectives and steps, we create meta-instructions that are optimal, robust, and maintainable, providing a solid foundation for further project development.

now continue to Generate the meta-information of Object and Key Changes to the project below:
