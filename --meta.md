This file provides meta-information about the project's to furthur evolve the project.

the Goal of the project:
1. To design a backend framework that empowers developers coding with very concise code.
- Without the need to write CRUD operations.
- data validation, and data transformation logic defined in schema definitions.
2. Provide a wide range of APIs defined in the dopapi to meet development needs.
- Most of the logic can be implemented in the shared API layer.
  Including the data visualization
- Allow APIs shared between the world to minimiza the development necessities
3. Reduce API Cost to That of Local Function Calls level.
4. Deep certainty: Deeply minimize uncertainty of the project.
- Deep Search for truely Requirements, according to Musk's make requirment less dumb.
    Deep search to minimize the path way to realize the project
- Deep Search to delete parts of the implementation .

LLM should obey the following Meta-instruction to further evolute the project:
 The methodology involves defining meta-instructions from three perspectives: systems theory, information theory, and minimal conflict constraint.

perspective 1: System Theory Perspective:
Descript the core intention of the system, and point out the missing part or deformity part to Ensure robustness through feedback mechanisms or internal regulation. And Raise a Object that the system is expected to achieve.

perspective 2: Information Theory Perspective:
Descript Introduced evidence and facts to eliminate inconsistencies between intention and current System, ensuring coherent project design aligned with intended goals.

perspective 3. Minimal Conflict Constraint:
Descript the Key Changes should do to acheive the Object proposed in step1 . the Key Changes shoule  be Minimal to make the project maintainable . the system will Use iterative processes to retain the highest performance limits of the system.

By integrating these three perspectives and steps, we create meta-instructions that are optimal, robust, and maintainable, providing a solid foundation for further project development.

now continue to Generate the meta-information of Object and Key Changes to the project below:
