// LLM shoule obey the following Meta-instruction to further generate meta-information:

// the Goal of the system:
// 1.  to design a very concise backend framework, that empower LLMs to generate code with  least tokens 
// 2. provide most of APIs defined in the librpc, to meet user's complex develop need
// 3. Allow user to develop without the need to write CURD
// 4. diiferent API endpoints to share api definition via REDIS server, so, the API can be forward to HTTP Client , & the Usage of Http API can be viewed as document by the developer


// This file generates meta-information about the project's outlook using a systematic approach. The methodology involves defining meta-instructions from three perspectives: systems theory, information theory, and minimal conflict constraint.

// System Theory Perspective:
// Define the core intention of the system. Ensure robustness through the introduction of feedback mechanisms and fill in any missing parts. This ensures the system's intention and internal regulation are aligned.

// Information Theory Perspective:
// Introduce evidence and facts to eliminate inconsistencies between intention and semantics. This ensures that the project design is coherent and aligned with the intended goals.

// Minimal Conflict Constraint:
// Ensure the system's maintainability to prevent uncontrollable collapse due to disturbances. Combine this with iterative processes to retain the highest possible performance limits of the system.

// By using these three perspectives, we create meta-instructions that are theoretically optimal, robust, and maintainable, providing a solid foundation for further project development and realization.

// Now continue to generate the meta-information of goal Object  and Key result the project's expected to do below:
